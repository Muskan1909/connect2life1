<b>Asthma</b></br>

A condition in which a person's airways become inflamed, narrow and</br>
swell and produce extra mucus, which makes it difficult to breathe.</br>

Asthma can be minor or it can interfere with daily activities. In some</br>
cases, it may lead to a life-threatening attack.</br>
Asthma may cause difficulty breathing, chest pain, cough and wheezing.</br>

Asthma can usually be managed with rescue inhalers to treat symptoms</br>
